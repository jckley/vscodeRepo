FROM clause for only one sObject type
SELECT clause to pick fields from the selected sObject, or COUNT() to perform an aggregation of the results
WHERE clause to filter your data
ORDER BY clause with support for ASC, DESC, NULLS FIRST, and NULLS LAST
LIMIT clause

You can also open a .soql file in SOQL Builder from the VS Code menu.
